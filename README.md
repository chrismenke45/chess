# Chess
I made command line chess and hosted it on [replit.](https://replit.com/@chrismenke45/Chess?v=1)

## How its made:
Tech used: Ruby
<br />
This was made with plain ruby to practice OOP. The piece's functionality were encapsulated and abstracted from the board.  All the pieces inherited from a Piece module. Polymorphism allowed all the different piece classes to be called similarly in the game.
## Optimizations
This could could have been broken into even smaller pieces. I also wrote my algorithms with loops, but I could have used recursion in my check and checkmate functions
## Lessons Learned
This project made me realize how powerful OOP is. With the inheritance of the Piece module on all the pieces I saved so much time kept my code cleaner than I have in the past.
